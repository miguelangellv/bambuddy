**Bambuddy 0.2.4.8**

**⚠ Upgrade Notes — Read Before Updating**

0.2.4.8 is a fix-led patch release on the same 0.2.4 code base — no schema breaks beyond auto-migrated column additions (dialect-branched for SQLite and Postgres), no Docker entrypoint changes. The in-app Apply Update button in Settings → System → Updates works for Docker and for any native install already on 0.2.4.x.

Three behaviour-change callouts to know about before you upgrade:

- SSO autologin landed as a per-OIDC-provider opt-in (#1589, requested by @einstux). No existing install changes behaviour on upgrade — local login stays enabled by default and no provider is marked as autologin. To enable: turn on the new `is_autologin` flag on exactly one enabled OIDC provider in Settings → Auth, optionally disable local login at the same screen, and unauthenticated visitors will be redirected to your IdP on mount. A `BAMBUDDY_LOCAL_LOGIN=true` env-var bypasses both gates if your SSO provider is unreachable, and `/login?fallback=local` is a bookmarkable always-shows-the-form URL. Two refusal modes protect against lockout: disabling local login is rejected unless at least one OIDC provider is enabled AND the calling admin has a UserOIDCLink row.

- Sponsor-prompt thresholds lowered to fire for typical installs. The lowest print milestone drops from 100 → 10, archives from 50 → 5, and cost from 100 → 25 (EUR). Installs that already saw a sponsor toast within the last 14 days won't see more — the cross-family cooldown is unchanged. Installs that have never crossed the old 100-print bar become eligible the first time they pass 10 prints. The toast itself is the existing one, copy unchanged.

- Printer card UI refresh (#1661). Visual change on the main Printers page — re-arranged for structure and readability. The Filaments section header now carries the new AMS Filament Backup badge (blue circle-arrow when on, dim when off, "?" on A1 family where the cfg bit isn't yet parsed). External tray slots show `L` / `R` inside the colour circle instead of a separate `Ext-L` / `Ext-R` caption underneath, equalising the bottom row's height. No data-model change; existing customisation persists.

Make a backup before upgrading via Settings → Backup → Create Backup. Native install with update.sh snapshots the database automatically and rolls back on failure. Docker and fully-manual paths don't.

**Docker**

```
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

docker-compose.yml doesn't need refreshing for 0.2.4.8.

**Native install — recommended path**

```
sudo BRANCH=main /opt/bambuddy/install/update.sh
```

Snapshots the database first and rolls back on failure.

**Native install — manual path**

```
sudo systemctl stop bambuddy
cd /opt/bambuddy
sudo -u bambuddy git fetch --prune --tags --force origin
sudo -u bambuddy git checkout main
sudo -u bambuddy git reset --hard origin/main
sudo /opt/bambuddy/venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
cd frontend && sudo npm i
sudo systemctl start bambuddy
```

**Windows install**

Download `bambuddy-0.2.4.8-windows-x64-setup.exe` from this release page (or the unversioned `bambuddy-windows-x64-setup.exe` alias for an always-latest link). The In-app "Install Update" button on Windows installs now uses the same release-asset flow — no more "Could not find git executable" failures.

**Highlights**

0.2.4.8 is dominated by three threads: **AMS Filament Backup** becoming a first-class surface, **SSO autologin** for operators running their own OIDC, and a heavy contributor-credited fix sweep across notifications, the Virtual Printer, SpoolBuddy, and the queue.

The AMS Filament Backup thread closes the gap reporters @jpcast2001 and @Arn0uDz hit on dual-AMS X1C farms — when one slot ran low, the deficit check ignored a same-material backup peer and blocked the print. Bambuddy now reads and writes the per-printer backup state from the printer card (new badge in the Filaments section header), mirrors it into the colour-strict deficit check (#1762), and threads it into the dispatcher's "Prefer lowest" sort (#1766) so the spool that ought to run dry first really does. The mid-print spool-switch attribution bug @biduleman hit (#1771) — the firmware's end-of-print `total_layer_num=0` push was clobbering the cached total, collapsing every previous segment to 0g — is fixed in the same train.

SSO autologin (#1589) lands as a per-OIDC-provider opt-in with safety refusals on the disable-local-login toggle to prevent lockout, plus an env-var recovery path and a bookmarkable `/login?fallback=local`. See Upgrade Notes for the full surface.

Notifications got a sweep: false-positive "Print Stopped" on reprint after MQTT reconnect (#1807), finish-photo dropped on FINISH-state fallback (#1790), completion notification scoping the whole multi-plate project instead of the printed plate (#1785), and "Printer offline" push never firing on the disconnect edge (#1752) all fixed by separate contributors and reporters.

The Virtual Printer surface got another #1780 round driven by reporter @mkoreen — three commits bumping the slicer-MQTT race window to 5s with retroactive stamp, correcting a VP intake key mismatch that was silently dropping every slicer field, and forwarding the H2C rack-swap nozzle pick from slicer to dispatch.

Smaller-but-load-bearing: **per-printer Maintenance Mode** (#1476) so a printer can be excluded from the dispatcher without unplugging it, **per-filament humidity threshold for auto-drying** (#1605), **drag-reorder for grouped queue items**, and **heater history** (nozzle / bed / chamber) tracked with a per-tile chart-icon overlay opening the history modal.

---
**New Features**

- AMS Filament Backup status badge + toggle on the printer card; "Prefer lowest" actually picks the lowest spool (#1766, reported by @biduleman). Three states — ON (blue circle-arrow), OFF (dim), Unknown ("?" on A1 family where the cfg bit isn't parsed yet). Click toggles via the new `POST /printers/{id}/ams-backup` endpoint (gated on `printers:control`).

- Backup-aware filament deficit check, colour-strict (#1762, reported by @jpcast2001 + @Arn0uDz). Pre-print check sums grams across same-material backup peers instead of treating each slot in isolation.

- SSO autologin + disable local username/password login (#1589, requested by @einstux). Per-OIDC-provider `is_autologin` flag and `BAMBUDDY_LOCAL_LOGIN` env-var recovery path. See Upgrade Notes.

- Per-printer Maintenance Mode toggle (#1476, requested by @IndividualGhost1905 / Ferdi SEVER). Excludes a printer from queue dispatch without disconnecting it — useful for swap-out / cleaning / firmware-flash windows.

- Per-filament humidity threshold for auto-drying + alarms (#1605, requested by @thenewguy). Replaces the single global threshold with per-filament overrides; falls back to global when unset.

- Heater history (nozzle / bed / chamber) tracked + per-tile chart-icon overlay opens history modal. Mirrors the existing AMS sensor history surface; same retention + sampling cadence.

- Updated printer card UI for structure and readability (#1661). See Upgrade Notes for the visual change summary.

- Drag-reorder for grouped queue items; collapsed batches no longer block adjacent rows.

- Forecasting groups spools by colour + Forecast UI rework (#1814, by @Keybored02).

- "Auto-add unknown RFID spools" toggle + global confirmation modal (#1764). Reporters with multi-operator workshops saw duplicate inventory rows accumulating; toggle defaults to today's auto-add behaviour for compatibility, the modal asks before adding when unset.

- In-app sponsor-toast at earned milestones (Prints / Cost / Archives / Anniversary / Version-update). Cooldown 14 days across all families.

- Prominent sponsor banner on Settings → General. Single dismissable banner above the existing settings list on the default landing tab.

- Lower sponsor-prompt thresholds. See Upgrade Notes.

**Changes**

- Printer card AMS row: external tray height matches regular AMS slots. L/R label now lives inside the slot's colour circle in place of the index; bottom `Ext-L` / `Ext-R` caption removed.

**Fixed**

**Notifications**

- False-positive "Print Stopped" notification on reprint after MQTT reconnect (#1807, reported by @volodymyr-doba).

- Print-complete notification no longer drops the finish photo when the FINISH-state fallback fires (#1790, reported by @needo37). Producer→consumer sync.

- Completion notification scoped to printed plate on multi-plate 3MFs (#1785). Multi-plate single-plate prints used to report the whole project's duration + material; now matches the queue card.

- Push notification for "Printer offline" actually fires (#1752, reported by @saint-hh). `on_printer_offline` dispatch wired on the disconnect edge — the callback existed but the wire was missing.

**Auth / OIDC / permissions**

- API keys with Manage Library permission can rename / delete / move library files (#1832, reporter @MorganMLGman). `LIBRARY_UPDATE_ALL` / `LIBRARY_DELETE_ALL` now map to `can_manage_library`; `LIBRARY_PURGE` stays admin-only.

- Sidebar entries for Files / Archives / Queue no longer hidden from non-admin users with granular `*_read` access (#1755, reported by @knifesk).

- Auth preserves the original URL across login + OIDC round-trip (#1750). Bookmarks land where the user clicked, not the dashboard.

- Printer secrets restricted to update-authority callers. Tightens which API surfaces can return access codes and credentials.

**Virtual printer / dispatch**

- H2C nozzle pick from Bambu Studio preserved on dual-nozzle rack variant + VP slicer-field intake (#1780, reported by @mkoreen). Three commits landed: slicer-MQTT race window bumped to 5s with retroactive stamp, VP intake key mismatch corrected, rack-swap nozzle pick forwarded to dispatch.

- Mid-print AMS Backup spool-switch correctly splits weight instead of crediting all to the second spool (#1771, reported by @biduleman). Cascades `state.total_layers` → `last_layer_num` → equal-split fence; firmware's end-of-print `total_layer_num=0` push no longer clobbers the cached total.

**Print queue + scheduler**

- `require_previous_success` no longer permanently blocks a printer's queue after a failure (#1818, reported by @jmassardo). Resume-after-failure clears the gate.

**Inventory / AMS / SpoolBuddy**

- Assign-spool picker note now visible on mobile (#793 follow-up, reporter @EmcetPL). Note rendered as a muted line under the weight on both internal and Spoolman branches; `title=` tooltip preserved for desktop hover.

- SpoolBuddy "Assign to AMS" preserves the user's slicer preset instead of pushing Generic (#1815, reported by @Bgabor997). Resolver now preserves PFUS / PFCN `setting_id`.

- SpoolBuddy inventory search matches spool ID, slicer filament name, and storage location (#1738, reported by @shaddowlink). Was filtering on spool name only.

- H2S active-tray highlight no longer stuck on AMS slot 1 during external-spool prints (#1822, reported by @ojimpo). `tray_now` promoted to 254 on all-external prints.

- Unknown-tag modal no longer pops for slots with no RFID.

**Connection / install**

- Connection diagnostic no longer reports false camera-port warning on A1 / A1 Mini / P1 (#1799 closing #1798, by @lesbass / Stefano Maffeis).

- Docker installer escalates on EACCES instead of failing on `/opt/bambuddy` (#1774, reported by @jmoore-skild). Auto-sudo on the directory create when needed.

- In-app "Install Update" on Windows installer switched to release-asset update flow — no more "Could not find git executable" failures.

**UI / rendering**

- Chamber-fan badge hidden on open-frame Bambu printers that have no chamber fan.

- Archive thumbnails rendered server-side when the sidecar slice skips them (#1759, reported by @VID-PRO).

- Local Presets page: deleted row optimistically removed instead of staying visible until refetch returned (which had allowed a second delete click → 404).

- AMS history modal respects theme background variant in stats modal.

- Post-#1661 printer-card cleanup — test fixtures + hover-card fly-in removal.

**Docs / archives**

- Archives "Step 4" docs link no longer 404s (#1812, reported by @Spanholz). Corrected `bambuddy.cool/wiki/...` host to `wiki.bambuddy.cool/...`.

- Archives backfill NULL `created_at` + tolerate NULL in response (#1732). Old archive rows from upgrades that ran before the column existed now render correctly.

---
**Security**

- dompurify 3.4.10 → 3.4.11 (GHSA-cmwh-pvxp-8882, moderate). Frontend HTML sanitisation library; no Bambuddy code change.

- Backend dependency security floor bumps — cryptography, python-multipart, starlette. Floor raises so fresh installs and CI pick up the fixed runtime.

- Floor pins for pydantic-settings ≥2.14.2 + msgpack ≥1.2.1 to clear `pip-audit`.

- Vite 7 → 8 + plugin-react 5.2 (major bump) + frontend dependency bumps.

- 422 constant rename — pinpoints the dependency-related security response constant.
